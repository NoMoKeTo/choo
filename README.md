# choo [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/codingcatgirl/choo.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/codingcatgirl/choo)

choo is a uniform interface for public transport APIs written in Python 3. A JSON interface will be available via command line and HTTP to use it with other languages.

**choo is still in pre-alpha stage, currently undergoing heavy refactoring and nowhere near to be used yet.** If you want to look at old code and the legacy API, check out [v0.2.0](https://github.com/codingcatgirl/choo/tree/0.2.0).
